  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
   - portraits_placeholder.webp

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
fonts:
    - family: Pacifico
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Pacifico-Regular.ttf
